**Motivation**

By 2035, a third, it was estimated that around a third of Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above, while the median age was also expected to rise from 39.7 in 2015 to 53.4 in 2050. Even though we are growing up to become young adults, our parents are also getting older. In addition, the pandemic has shown us that we will never know when we will get sick, but it is how we deal with it and overcome it.

A little closer to home, one of us has a grandmother who is diagnosed with high blood pressure and does not reside in the same location as him. It is often worrying as he is afraid his grandmother might miss her medication timing, doctor’s appointment, or even eating the appropriate foods. With the advent of technology, we would like to use technology to be a health companion. As people say “Health is wealth”.


**Aim** 

We hope to make an all-rounder app to aid the elderly on the healthcare side. Make it not only useful but also an easy and simple interface that the elderly are able to use with ease. It will be a one-stop shop for the elderly.


**User Stories**

1.As an elderly who has poor memory/dementia, I want to be reminded to take my medication on time.

2.As an elderly who has little knowledge of technology and has to go for biannual reviews, I want to get details about it as easily as possible and possibly have reminders in case it slips my mind.

3.As a son/daughter who is caring and filial, I want to be able to keep track of my parents’ health and play a part in keeping them healthy, especially if I am not staying together with them.

4.As an elderly who is staying apart from my sons and daughters, I want to be able to contact my family members in times of emergency, in the quickest method possible.

5.As an elderly or child who does not know much about the nutrition content of foods, I would want to make sure no dietary requirements are being compromised or breached.


**Features**

The Medication Alarm is one function of the app that provides timely audio reminders for the elderly to take their medication, with a simple interface that could be programmed once at the start and could be recurring, till deemed to be suitable to stop. Not only that, once the alarm stops, a simple message could be sent to the family member’s mobile to update their close ones.

The Close Friends Contacts is another function that stores the contacts of those frequently contacted, and the user can call any of them by simply pressing on the contact. The contact names will be displayed in large font, with the option of adding a display picture for each contact for easier identification by the user.

The Inactivity Alert notifies those in the Close Friends Contacts when the app has been unopened for more than a day. (Turning off the medication alarm is considered as opening the app, so the user will likely be opening the app on a daily basis). Maybe can consider partnering up with Government in the future for incentives such as daily log in.

The Automatic Fall Detector makes use of the in-built accelerometer in the user’s mobile phone to detect when the mobile phone has fallen, which may possibly be an indication that the user has fallen as well. This sends an alert to the user’s Close Friends Contacts, and a big button occupying most of the screen will appear on the user’s phone. Pressing the button will call a pre-programmed contact of the user immediately. 

Teleconferencing of doctors. If they have monthly reviews with doctors, there will be a feature with a reminder plus zoom link for ease of convenience for both elderly and family members. They do not have to go through the hassle of going through emails or tedious methods to look for this information, which might cause the elderly to not attend the reviews as they are too troublesome.

Possible Day and Meal Planner for those with dietary requirements. Inputting their illness, or their dietary requirement and the meal planner will suggest them with different types of foods that suit their dietary requirement. For instance, a high blood pressure diet will consist of low sodium meals, more whole grains and lean protein meals. Also recommendations for activities to keep themselves active such as taichi and walks.

  a) Type "node -v" in the command prompt/terminal, if a version number starting with "v" followed by some numbers returns, NodeJS has been installed
  b) Type "npm -v" in the command prompt/terminal, if some numbers indicating the version number of npm returns, npm has been installed
3) Next, we install Expo CLI using npm
4) Type into command prompt/terminal "npm install expo-cli --global"
5) Lastly, download Expo GO on your android/IOS device to run the application on your phones
6) Now we're done with the installations!
7) To run the application, use the command prompt/terminal to change directory to the app's folder (the app folder containing package.json)
8) Type in "expo start" in command prompt/terminal, and a QR code should appear
9) Don't scan the QR code in the command prompt/terminal
10) Type 'd' in command prompt/terminal, and a new webpage should open in your browser
11) Select 'Tunnel' above the QR code in that webpage, and wait for the new QR code to be displayed on the same webpage
12) Scan the QR code using the Expo GO app/phone camera(Android/IOS), and the application will automatically appear on your mobile phones
